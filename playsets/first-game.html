        <h1>The First Game - An Introduction to Two Rooms and a Boom</h1>
        <p>This playset serves as a solid introductory game for new players.</p> 
        
        <h2>Roles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>President/Bomber</li>
            <li>Doctor/Engineer</li> 
            <li>r/b Spy</li>
            <li>r/b Coy Boy</li>
            <li>Romeo/Juliet</li>
            <li>MI6 (if odd number of players)</li>
            <li>Blue and Red Team (as needed to fill player count)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>To start, it includes the base roles of <strong>President</strong> and <strong>Bomber</strong>, and their <strong>Doctor</strong> and <strong>Engineer</strong>. Because the main roles will have to full share with the respective secondary roles, this encourages card sharing. </p>
        
        <p>Included are <strong>Spies</strong> and <strong>Coy Boys</strong> on each team. Though card sharing is encouraged, the spies keep everyone on their toes and the coy boys give them a reasonable way to "hide."</p>
        
        <p>Also added are <strong>Romeo</strong> and <strong>Juliet</strong>. These are great grey roles that have a fun idea behind them that's easy to understand.</p>
        
        <p>Depending on player counts, the rest are filled with basic <strong>Blue Team</strong> and <strong>Red Team</strong> roles. If there is an odd number of players, the <strong>MI6</strong> can be added to balance teams out.</p>
